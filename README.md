# Acknowledgement
My implementation is mainly based on the following and models and codebases. 
Big appreciation to the authors for their wonderful works.

- [MogaNet](https://github.com/Westlake-AI/MogaNet) - used as a backbone
- [Convolutional Vision Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/CvT) - used as a base for FCN
- [DAMO-YOLO](https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO) - FCN-like architecture, used as a baseline too
- [FastMETRO](https://github.com/postech-ami/FastMETRO) - one of the inspirations for my model
